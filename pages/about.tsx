					<AboutText>
							After graduating college with a B.S in Psychology. I tried many career paths to find a career path. I went through a plenty full of ups and downs trying to find out what career path would be the best for me with my background and skills. I first attempted UX design where I realized early on that this career path would not be the best fit for me but I tried it, and ultimatley relaized that it wasn't for me. After I tried software engineering as a career path and learned alot about programming and buliding web applications. I attended a three month boocamp to learn full stack web development. Saying that it was extremely hard is an understatment! I went through the whole interview gaulent that was software engineering and began to do some work for a startup. After contributing for some days I realized in that moment that I couldn't see myself programming day in and day out as a career path. While taking a step back and doing some research, I stumbled onto a cyber sercurtiy youtube channel talking about security and tech news. I then proceeded to binge watch the videos and research more into a career in cyber security. Something clicked where now I am excited to learn more about cyber security and the constant challnges organiations face protecting their assets. I believe the psychological aspects of cybersecurity and my desire to understand threact actors and how they compromise organizations lead me to currently wanting to be a cyber security professional. I eventuall want to get into a leadership position as a CISO and help individuals in underserved communities gain the knowledge to start and thrive in thier Cybersecurity career.
